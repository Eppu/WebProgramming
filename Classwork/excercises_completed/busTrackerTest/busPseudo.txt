Set up references to HTML elements

set up an array with desired bus id's

fetch API data

set up a new Google Map

create bus markers based on chosen bus id's
  for(let i = 0; i < allBuses.length; i++){
    if(allBuses includes chosenBusId[i] ){
      current location = current buses location;
      create a new google maps marker with the position as the current bus location
    }
  }

fetch the api data and update markers once per second

const busesToShow = allBuses.filter(bus => (bus.line === linesofinterest))


You already have an array of chosenBusLines. Make the user interaction with the html update this array by adding or removing items to/from it.

then in storeBusData(thisBus) have something like..
 if(chosenBusLines.includes(thisBus.line))
//add a marker to the map
//create a busmarker object (which usefully should include the bus line as well as the //bus id and the marker)
//push this to the array of all markers (which you have called markers)
then in updateBusData(thisBus), you could check whether you have created a marker for this bus, if you have then update its position

 if(busAlreadyHasMarker(thisBus) >= 0 )
//update marker position to thisBus.latitude, thisBus.longitude
function busAlreadyHasMarker(busItem)
  for all items in markers array
   if marker[n].busId == busItem.id
// position of first match, there should only be 1 as busId's should be unique
return n
  // if no match
  return -1
